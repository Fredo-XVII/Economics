# BLS Implements HTTPS-Only Standard on bls.gov websites
In order to comply with the HTTPS-Only Standard for all Federal websites, BLS has migrated all BLS.gov websites from HTTP to HTTPS.
To avoid future disruption, BLS.gov users are strongly recommended to update saved links or bookmarks, automated scripts, API signatures, documentation, etc., and begin using HTTPS in the URL for BLS.gov website as soon as possible.
The new HTTPS URLs for all BLS.gov websites are as follows:

•	https://www.bls.gov
•	https://data.bls.gov
•	https://download.bls.gov
•	https://beta.bls.gov
•	https://api.bls.gov/
